# UI Agent - Task 13: Performance Optimization

## Task ID: 13-UI
## Dependencies: All UI tasks (2-11)
## Priority: High
## Order: 12

## Description
Optimize the application for performance, ensuring 60fps animations, fast loading times, and excellent Core Web Vitals scores.

## Subtasks

### 13.1 Animation Performance
- [ ] Profile all animations with Chrome DevTools
- [ ] Ensure 60-120fps on all animations
- [ ] Use GPU acceleration where possible
- [ ] Implement will-change hints carefully
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

### 13.2 Safari-Specific Optimizations
- [ ] Test scroll animations on Safari
- [ ] Verify backdrop-filter support
- [ ] Check spring animation performance
- [ ] Test touch gestures on iOS Safari
- [ ] Fix Safari-specific rendering issues

### 13.3 Image Optimization
- [ ] Configure Next.js Image properly
- [ ] Implement progressive loading
- [ ] Add blur placeholders
- [ ] Optimize image formats (WebP, AVIF)
- [ ] Set proper cache headers

### 13.4 Code Splitting
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports
- [ ] Lazy load heavy components
- [ ] Split vendor bundles
- [ ] Analyze bundle size
- [ ] Remove unused code

### 13.5 Reduce Motion Support
- [ ] Detect prefers-reduced-motion
- [ ] Provide animation alternatives
- [ ] Test with reduced motion enabled
- [ ] Ensure functionality without animations
- [ ] Document accessibility features

### 13.6 Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (< 2.5s)
- [ ] Minimize First Input Delay (< 100ms)
- [ ] Eliminate Cumulative Layout Shift (< 0.1)
- [ ] Improve First Contentful Paint (< 1.8s)
- [ ] Reduce Time to Interactive (< 3.8s)

### 13.7 Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add performance marks
- [ ] Implement RUM tracking
- [ ] Set up performance budgets
- [ ] Create performance dashboard
- [ ] Document performance targets

## Validation Steps
1. [ ] Lighthouse score > 90 all categories
2. [ ] 60fps animations consistently
3. [ ] < 3s page load time
4. [ ] Safari performs smoothly
5. [ ] Bundle size < 200KB gzipped

## Git Commit
After completing all tasks:
```bash
npm run build
npm run analyze  # Check bundle size
# Run Lighthouse audit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: optimize performance with code splitting, image optimization, and Safari fixes"
```

## Notes
- Performance is critical for user experience
- Test on real devices, not just dev machines
- Consider network throttling in tests
- Monitor performance post-deployment
